CCAT BINARY TO [XML/TEXT] TEST FILES

Each test has four files associated with it. For example, the SQSB test file has the following:
	SQSB.bin : The binary container file used as input for ccat 
	SQSB.in  : the original container text file that SQSB.bin was generated from 
	SQSB.xml : Expected XML output from running ccat -x on SQSB.bin
	SQSB.txt : Expected TXT output from running ccat on SQSB.bin

The binary (*.bin) container files used in these tests were all generated from
the original *.in files, which are included here.

The numbered testXX.in files were designed to exercise all parts of the library
and reproduce bugs.  

test01.in : - Lots of weird, tricky container names, most with colons
test02.in : - Containers with and without a trailing colon
			- Empty containers
test03.in : - Examples of boundary values for every type
			- Multiple leaf nodes with the same name
			- blank lines
			- whitespace-only lines
			- uses both spaces and tabs for indenting
test04.in : - tests negative values in ENUMs
test05.in : - tests IP32 Arrays
test06.in : - Uses hex in node names

The files in from_grid/ were taken from a live grid running StorageGrid Webscale 10.4.0 (pre-release.)

The files in invalid/ are supposed to be unparseable.  Some of them are actually parsed by ADE ccat though.

Tests are run on the binary files (*.bin), which are generated from their
corresponding text files (*.in).  The xml files are known good versions of the
XML files produced by running a binary to xml conversion on each binary file.
