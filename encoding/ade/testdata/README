CCAT BINARY TO [XML/TEXT] TEST FILES

Each test has four files associated with it. For example, the SQSB test file has the following:
	SQSB.bin : The binary container file used as input for ccat 
	SQSB.in  : the original container text file that SQSB.bin was generated from 
	SQSB.xml : Expected XML output from running ccat -x on SQSB.bin
	SQSB.txt : Expected TXT output from running ccat on SQSB.bin

The binary (*.bin) container files used in these tests were all generated from
the original *.in files, which are included here.

The numbered testXX.in files were designed to exercise all parts of the library
and reproduce bugs.  

test01.in : - Lots of weird, tricky container names, most with colons
test02.in : - Containers with and without a trailing colon
			- Empty containers
test03.in : - Examples of boundary values for every type
			- Multiple leaf nodes with the same name
			- blank lines
			- whitespace-only lines
			- uses both spaces and tabs for indenting
test04.in : - tests negative values in ENUMs
test05.in : - tests IP32 Arrays
test06.in : - Uses hex in node names

The files in from_grid/ were taken from a live grid running StorageGrid Webscale 10.4.0 (pre-release.)

The files in invalid/ are supposed to be unparseable.  Some of them are actually parsed by ADE ccat though.

Tests with "noroundtrip" in the test name will skip the tests for binary-identical original and output.

Tests are run on the binary files (*.bin), which are generated from their
corresponding text files (*.in).  The xml files are known good versions of the
XML files produced by running a binary to xml conversion on each binary file.

Added resources.noroundrip test as part of handling mis-encoded inputs from StorageGRID.
These are marked "noroundtrip" because the binary form has extra bytes that
must be discarded when reading the binary stream. The binary output is lacks
these garbage bytes and does not match the binary input.
